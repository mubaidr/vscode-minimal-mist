## Optional (Settings for Minimal Workspace)

You can also use following settings (my current setup) to reduce clutter and make your workspace even more minimal, without scrificing any functionality. Add these settings to your `settings.json` file in VSCode to achieve the same look as in the screenshots above:

```jsonc
"editor.renderLineHighlight": "none",
"editor.scrollbar.vertical": "hidden",
"window.commandCenter": false,
"window.menuBarVisibility": "compact",
"window.titleBarStyle": "custom",
"workbench.editor.tabActionCloseVisibility": false,
"workbench.editor.tabSizing": "fixed",
"workbench.editor.tabSizingFixedMaxWidth": 240,
"workbench.editor.tabSizingFixedMinWidth": 180,
"workbench.sideBar.location": "right",
"workbench.statusBar.visible": false,
"workbench.tree.indent": 22,
"workbench.tree.renderIndentGuides": "none",
```
